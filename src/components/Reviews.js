        <p>Jacob has excellent rapport skills. He demonstrated that he was able to work productively with all levels of staff and a wide variety of customers. When he encounters challenging or confusing situations, he has excellent listening and question-asking skills that allow him to discern what is most important and continue to work productively alone and with others.</p>

        <p>Jacob is the ideal team player. He takes the lead on projects, but also knows when to step back and assist others with their vision. He listens to those around him and lets their voices be heard. He truly brings out the best in his peers.</p>
        <p>I would definitely work with Jacob again because of his great work ethic, adaptability to change, and willingness to step up to any challenge out before him.</p>
